# pyTagger

local server for tagging Pictures

exiftool is needed for reading and writing the exif data 

run server:

`python server.py [path to some pictures]`

then open http://127.0.0.1:5000/


Intented for local use. Do not run on production servers.

Security notice: it's insecure! I implemented some security features but. Do not expect it to be save.
